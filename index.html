            Hope Lioness Brown is my 7 year old furry baby. She's a referred to as a <em>Lynx Point Siamese</em> cat, which is a mix between Tabby and Siamese. </p>
                <aside>In the article, “Lynx Point Siamese Cats - Siamese cats with stripes!” by Caroline Haines, published on life-with-siamese-cats.com, she reminds us that, "[t]echnically, there's really no such thing as a 'Lynx Point Siamese' cat. This is because the American Cat Fanciers' Association refers to a Siamese-type cat with lynx markings as a Lynx ColorPoint Shorthair. Confusingly, the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy in the UK calls the same kind of cat a Tabby Point Siamese."</aside>
                <p>Hope is absolutely gorgeous and I think she knows it. She grooms herself often, especially if something or someone touches her fur and changes its direction.

            <h3>She's Just Like Me</h3>
           <p><img src="assets/images/img_3349.jpg" width="250px" alt = "kissing hope">
            <em>Hope's personality is a lot like mine.</em> Sometimes I call for her, just to see where she is. I start to miss her company pretty quickly. So, I'll find her and pet her for a moment and then return to what I was previsously doing. I didn't realize I was creating a monster. She now mirrors this behavior. She'll meow until she finds me, rub against me once or twice, and then she'll go back to taking a nap elsewhere.
        </p>
            <p>I believe Hope gets her bossiness from me, too. Usually, I beat my husband to bed at night. If he's up late, I'll call for him and tell him that it's bedtime. Well, every night at about 9pm Hope starts meowing. I follow her to see what she needs and she leads me to my bedroom. She's usually content after I explain that I'm not ready for bed yet, but will be soon. She also meows for me to get out of bed in the morning. However, she quiets down for a little while if I tell her I need 5 more minutes.
        </p> 
            <p>You've probably guessed by now that we have full conversations with eachother. She's very intelligent and probably understands at least 75&percnt; of the things I say. I believe cat's can learn just as much as dogs, however they are more stubborn when it's time to perform. I must admit, I am most proud of <i><b>teaching her to give me a kiss.</b></i>

            <h3>Hope's Favorite Things</h3>
            <p><img src="assets/images/img_3288.jpg" width="400px" alt = "hope napping on my hw">
            Hope has several consistent ways to entertain herself. She loves to play with balls. Her favorite is a yarn-like ball, but she loves any kind that she can carry in her mouth. While playing, she sometimes starts to meow very loudly. I haven't determined if she's yelling at the ball to be still or if she's losing the game!
        </p>
            <p>Like most cats, Hope gets pretty wild while I'm trying to sleep at night.
        </p>
            <p>She runs all around 
            <br>&nwArr; &neArr; &seArr; &swArr; 
            <br>and up &amp; down 
            <br> &vArr; 
            <br>and left &amp; right! 
            <br> &hArr; 
                <br>
        </p>
            <p>She also enjoys playing a game that consists of biting my ankles when I walk by. This is something new that she's started and I'm trying to put an end to it now. <strong>It hurts!</strong> 
        </p>
            <p>I would also like for her to let me do my homework without laying on my notebook, Macbook, or keyboard. <em>But that's asking for a lot.</em>
        </p>
            <p>Whenver I'm not feeling well she cuddles up beside me. This is her activity that I love the most. She pretty much becomes my shadow until I'm feeling better. Then she's back to her normal ways, which means she'll cuddle with you on her terms. I love her and her crazy personality. She's my daughter and my best friend!

        <section>
           <h3>Standard Expenses</h3>
                <p>When you become a cat mom or dad there are certain expenses that you can expect to incur. You need to be able to afford food, litter, and toys. These items can be pricy depending on your cats preferences and your lifestyle. For example, my cat eats prescription food, she has the Breeze Cat Litter System, and she's spoiled with lots of toys.</p>
            <h3>Unexpected Expenses</h3>
                <p>When unforeseen circumstances arise, the expenses can be very high. For example, medical bills range from a couple hundred to thousands of dollars. Another unforeseen expense can incur if you need a catsitter, which are available for a daily or nightly fee. Cats are self-sufficient, but not for long periods of time.</p>
