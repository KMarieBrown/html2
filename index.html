            <p>Hope is my 7 year old furry baby. She's a <em>Lynx Point Siamese</em> cat, which is a mix between tabby and siamese. She's absolutely gorgeous and I think she knows it. She grooms herself often, especially if something or someone touches her fur and changes its direction.

        <h3>She's Just Like Me</h3>
            <article><img src="images/img_3349.jpg" width="250px" alt = "kissing hope"></article>
            <p><em>Hope's personality is a lot like mine.</em> Sometimes I call for her, just to see where she is. I start to miss her company pretty quickly. So, I'll find her and pet her for a moment and then return to what I was previsously doing. I didn't realize I was creating a monster. She now mirrors this behavior. She'll meow until she finds me, rub against me once or twice, and then she'll go back to taking a nap elsewhere.
        </p>
            <p>I believe Hope gets her bossiness from me, too. Usually, I beat my husband to bed at night. If he's up late, I'll call for him and tell him that it's bedtime. Well, every night at about 9pm Hope starts meowing. I follow her to see what she needs and she leads me to my bedroom. She's usually content after I explain that I'm not ready for bed yet, but will be soon. She also meows for me to get out of bed in the morning. However, she quiets down for a little while if I tell her I need 5 more minutes.
        </p> 
            <p>You've probably guessed by now that we have full conversations with eachother. She's very intelligent and probably understands at least 75&percnt; of the things I say. I believe cat's can learn just as much as dogs, however they are more stubborn when it's time to perform. I must admit, I am most proud of <i><b>teaching her to give me a kiss.</b></i>

        <h3>Hope's Favorite Things</h3>
            <article><img src="images/img_3288.jpg" width="400px" alt = "hope napping on my hw"></article>
            <p>Hope has several consistent ways to entertain herself. She loves to play with balls. Her favorite is a yarn-like ball, but she loves any kind that she can carry in her mouth. While playing, she sometimes starts to meow very loudly. I haven't determined if she's yelling at the ball to be still or if she's losing the game!
        </p>
            <p>Like most cats, Hope gets pretty wild while I'm trying to sleep at night.
        </p>
            <p>She runs all around 
            <br>&nwArr; &neArr; &seArr; &swArr; 
            <br>and up &amp; down 
            <br> &vArr; 
            <br>and left &amp; right! 
            <br> &hArr; 
                <br>
        </p>
            <p>She also enjoys playing a game that consists of biting my ankles when I walk by. This is something new that she's started and I'm trying to put an end to it now. <strong>It hurts!</strong> 
        </p>
            <p>I would also like for her to let me do my homework without laying on my notebook, Macbook, or keyboard. <em>But that's asking for a lot.</em>
        </p>
            <p>Whenver I'm not feeling well she cuddles up beside me. This is her activity that I love the most. She pretty much becomes my shadow until I'm feeling better. Then she's back to her normal ways, which means she'll cuddle with you on her terms. I love her and her crazy personality. She's my daughter and my best friend!
